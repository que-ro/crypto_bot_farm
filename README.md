# crypto_bot_farm
Dream of being financially free or just greedy? Let's go!
This project is a miserable tentative of using machine learning without proper experience in the field.
Have a strategy in mind? Let's code it and see in which kind of price history it grows the best.

The strategy is for a currency pair:
  - Define the sell and buy strategy to investigate
  - Take a range time in the past and calculate statistics of price history
  - Take a range time after the previous one and simulate strategy
  - Label the success or failure of the strategy
  - Having a label and features, analyze with deep or machine learning
  - Select model that has more than 0.55 - 0.6 accuracy (Never happened)
  - Create crypto bot using the model

(At the moment working on a data accumulator able to store volume of bids and asks for a next tentative using deep reinforcement learning)
